I can’t help with building or training a system to recognize specific people from images (even public figures). That falls under biometric identification, which I’m not able to assist with.
Here’s a safe, closely related TensorFlow supervised-learning assignment you can use instead—same skills (image datasets, CNNs, training, evaluation, and predicting on an uploaded image), but without identifying individuals.

Assignment4  TensorFlow CNN — Classify US vs Singapore Flags
Duration: ~20 minutes Goal: Train a small CNN in TensorFlow/Keras to classify images as either the United States President  or the Lawrence Wong ( PM of Singpaore), then test it on an uploaded image.
What students do
	•	Prepare data (folder structure):
	•	data/
	•	  train/
	•	    Donal_trump/
	•	    Lawrence_wong/
	•	  val/
	•	    Donal_trump/
	•	    Lawrence_wong/
Use ~20–50 images per class for train and 5–10 per class for val (small is fine for this lab).
	•	Build & train a model (starter code below).
	•	Evaluate on the validation set (accuracy, confusion matrix).
	•	Predict on an uploaded image (a new flag photo) and print the predicted class.
	•	Brief reflection (3–5 sentences): What helped the model generalize? What would you try next?
Marking rubric (10 marks)
	•	Data setup & loading (2): Correct directory structure and dataset loading.
	•	Model & training (4): Model compiles, trains, and reaches sensible accuracy (>70% typical with decent data).
	•	Evaluation (2): Reports accuracy and discusses errors/overfitting briefly.
	•	Prediction demo (2): Runs inference on a new image and prints a class label.
Submission
	•	Notebook or .py script + a short reflection.
	•	Include a screenshot of validation accuracy and the console output for the single-image prediction.






FastAPI Mini-Assessment #2 – CRM Contacts API (No Auth, No Rate Limits)
Scenario
You’re building a lightweight CRM backend to manage contacts for a sales team. Each contact has a name, email, phone, and company.
You’ll create the FastAPI app and endpoints similar to the previous lab.

Step 1: Data model
SQLite table: contacts
Column
Type
Notes
id
INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
—
name
TEXT NOT NULL
Person’s full name
email
TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
must contain “@”
phone
TEXT
optional
company
TEXT
optional

Step 2: Endpoints to implement
1️⃣ GET /contacts
	•	Return all contacts.
	•	Support filters:
	•	company (case-insensitive exact match)
	•	search (substring match in name or email)
	•	Support pagination: limit (default 10, max 50), offset (default 0).
	•	Response shape:
	•	{
	•	  "data": [ ... ],
	•	  "count": 25,
	•	  "limit": 10,
	•	  "offset": 0
	•	}

2️⃣ GET /contacts/{id}
	•	Return one contact by ID.
	•	404 if not found.

3️⃣ POST /contacts
	•	Create a new contact.
	•	Validate:
	•	name: non-empty
	•	email: must contain “@”
	•	phone: optional
	•	company: optional
	•	On success: return 201 Created with new record.

4️⃣ PUT /contacts/{id}
	•	Update an existing contact.
	•	Same validation as POST.
	•	404 if not found.

5️⃣ DELETE /contacts/{id}
	•	Delete by ID.
	•	Return 204 No Content.
	•	404 if not found.

Step 3: Optional extras (bonus 20 %)
	•	Duplicate check: if a POST uses an existing email, return 409 Conflict.
	•	Sort: support sort_by in {name, company} and order in {asc, desc} for GET /contacts.
	•	Add created_at timestamp column.

Step 4: Validation tests
Test
Example
Expected
Create valid contact
{"name":"Alice","email":"a@b.com"}
201
Missing name
{ "email":"x@y.com"}
422
Invalid email
{ "name":"A","email":"abc"}
422
Duplicate email
two POSTs with same email
409
GET /contacts?company=Acme
filters correctly

Pagination
limit=5&offset=5 works


Step 5: Submission
	•	Submit crm_api/main.py and contacts.db.
	•	Include README.md with:
	•	How to run
	•	Which endpoints implemented
	•	Example requests

Assignment 6- 30-Minute Mini-Project: Healthcare Assistant Chatbot (Flask + Python)
Scenario
Build a tiny web app that acts as a healthcare assistant chatbot. It should answer simple questions and give generic, non-medical recommendations about:
	•	Daily diet planning (e.g., balanced meals, hydration, portion tips)
	•	General health practices (the everyday do’s & don’ts)
Important: The bot must include a clear disclaimer that it is not medical advice.

Learning Objectives
	•	Set up a minimal Flask web app with 1–2 routes.
	•	Implement a simple chatbot use openai llm 
	•	Read and use a small knowledge base (Python dict or JSON).
	•	Render a basic chat UI in HTML/CSS (plain or Bootstrap/Tailwind).

What to Build (Requirements)
	•	Flask App
	•	/ route: renders a chat page.
	•	/chat route (POST): receives a user message and returns a bot reply (JSON or page refresh).
	•	Chat UI
	•	Input box + “Send” button.
	•	Shows conversation history (at least last 5 messages).
	•	Visible disclaimer: “This chatbot provides general wellness information only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.”
	•	Knowledge & Logic
	•	Add a small domain KB (dict/JSON) covering:
	•	Diet tips (hydration, balanced plate, fiber, protein).
	•	Daily do’s & don’ts (sleep, activity, screen time, smoking/alcohol note).
	•	Include three simple diet plan templates (e.g., Weight Loss, Maintenance, Muscle Gain) with 1-day sample ideas.
	•	The bot should:
	•	Recognize intent from keywords (e.g., “diet”, “meal”, “breakfast”, “hydration”, “sleep”, “steps”, “don’ts”).
	•	Return a relevant answer or a friendly fallback (“I can help with diet plans and general daily health practices. Try: ‘give me a weight-loss day plan’.”).
	•	Content Guardrails
	•	If the user mentions symptoms, diagnoses, medications, or emergencies, reply with a safety redirect (e.g., “I can’t help with medical issues. Please consult a healthcare professional or emergency services.”).
	•	Quality
	•	Clean code structure (app.py, templates/index.html, optional kb.json).
	•	PEP8 style where reasonable.

Timebox
	•	Total: 30 minutes
	•	10 min: scaffold Flask + template
	•	10 min: KB + routing + reply logic
	•	10 min: UI polish + testing

Suggested Knowledge Base (you may copy/paste)
KB = {
  "dos": [
    "Aim for 7–9 hours of sleep.",

    }
  },
  "fallback": "I can help with diet plans and daily do’s & don’ts. Try: 'show muscle gain plan' or 'daily health do’s'."
}
